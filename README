Getting started
---------------

quicktill is quite a complicated program to configure.  You should
start with an example configuration file, examples/pembury.py, and
edit it according to your needs.

You must create a postgresql database and make it accessible to
whichever user is running the till software.  Name this database in
the configuration file.

Put a URL pointing at the config file in /etc/quicktill/configurl
(eg. file:///home/till/configweb/pembury.py)

Create database tables:
> runtill syncdb

Get a draft database setup file and edit it:
> runtill dbsetup >database-config
> (edit database-config)
> runtill dbsetup database-config

Run in "stock control terminal" mode and enter your initial stock
(this mode doesn't require a special keyboard)
> runtill

Run in "cash register" mode, create stocklines, bind them to keys, put
your stock on sale, and sell it:
> runtill -c mainbar

Old notes that shouldn't be here
--------------------------------

What configuration goes where?

Default printer: printer.driver (includes connection details)
Kickout procedure: printer.kickout
Defined pages: tillconfig.pages (includes hotkeys etc.)
Database connection string: td.database
Keyboard driver: ui.kb (includes keyboard layout)
Kitchen printer: foodorder.kitchenprinter
Menu URL: foodorder.menuurl

Pub name: tillconfig.pubname
Pub phone number: tillconfig.pubnumber
Pub address: tillconfig.pubaddr

VAT rate (to be obsoleted): tillconfig.vatrate
VAT number (to be obsoleted): tillconfig.vatno
Business address (to be obsoleted): tillconfig.companyaddr

Currency symbol: tillconfig.currency
Keyboard layout number: tillconfig.kbtype
Cashback limit: tillconfig.cashback_limit

Price policy function (optional): tillconfig.pricepolicy(sd,qty)
Quantity string function (optional): tillconfig.qtystring(qty,unitname)
Currency format function (optional): tillconfig.fc(amount)
Price guess function (optional): tillconfig.priceguess(dept,cost,abv)

Things that shouldn't be set in a global config module:
  how to connect to the local receipt printer / kickout
  ...er, that's about it!

Keyboard layouts and associated pages can be global because they may
be shared.

So what we really want is a "runner" script that fetches the global
config file (location defined in an /etc file), picks out a particular
configuration by keyboard layout number, and optionally takes
arguments to override the default printer type.  This could be till.py
with __name__=='__main__'...
