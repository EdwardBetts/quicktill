Program can be run as soon as it is unpacked.

To create a blank dataset, do:

createdb dbname
psql dbname
\i createdb

To delete the entire dataset (no questions asked!):
dropdb dbname

The till software expects dbname to be "till" by default.
Update td.py if you use a different name.

(createdb, psql and dropdb are PostgreSQL commands.)
