{% if stockline.linetype == "regular" %}
<p>This is a "regular" stock line.  Regular stock lines can have at
  most one stock item on sale at any one time.  Finishing that stock
  item and putting another item on sale are done explicitly by the
  staff.  They are typically used where units are dispensed directly
  from the stock item to the customer and it's obvious to the member
  of staff when the stock item is empty, for example casks/kegs
  through a pump, bottles of spirits, cards or boxes of snacks, and so
  on.</p>

{% if not stockline.stockonsale %}
<p>There is nothing currently on sale on this stock line.</p>
{% endif %}
{% elif stockline.linetype == "display" %}
<p>This is a "display" stock line.  Display stock lines can have
  several stock items on sale at once.  Moving from one stock item to
  the next is automatic; when one item is empty the next is used.
  These stock lines have a "capacity", and the system keeps track of
  how many units of each stock item are "on display" and available to
  be sold; the "capacity" is the number of units that can be on
  display at any one time (for example, in a fridge).  Display stock
  lines are typically used where it isn't obvious to the member of
  staff where one stock item finishes and another one starts; for
  example, the bottles on display in a fridge may come from several
  different stock items.</p>
{% elif stockline.linetype == "continuous" %}
<p>This is a "continuous" stock line.  Continuous stock lines never
  have any stock items explicitly on sale.  Instead, when a sale is
  made the till searches for stock of the specified type that is not
  already on sale on another stock line, and uses that.  If a
  particular stock item doesn't have enough stock left for the whole
  sale, multiple stock items are used.  Continuous stock lines are
  typically used where a single sale (for example of a glass of wine)
  can come from multiple stock items (eg. where a wine bottle
  finishes, and the next bottle is from a different case).</p>
{% else %}
<p>This is a "{{stockline.linetype}}" stock line.  This web service
  has not yet been updated to support this type of stock line.</p>
