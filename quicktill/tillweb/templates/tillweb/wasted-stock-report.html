<h2>Wasted stock</h2>

<p>This report shows stock explicitly recorded as used, either as
  waste or by being sold, per department and per day.  It also shows
  stock implicitly wasted by being marked as "finished" as
  "Unaccounted"; this quantity is shown using the date the stock was
  marked as "finished".</p>
