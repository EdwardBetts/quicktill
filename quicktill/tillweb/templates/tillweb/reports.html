<h2>Wasted stock</h2>

<p>This report shows stock explicitly recorded as used, either as
  waste or by being sold.  It doesn't show stock implicitly wasted by
  being marked as "finished".</p>

<h2 class="mt-3">Sold stock by type</h2>

<p>This report shows amounts of stock recorded as sold.  Voids are
  treated as negative sales.</p>
<p>There are two dates associated with sales, and you can choose
  either one when choosing sales for this report:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Transaction Date: the date of the transaction in which the stock
    is sold.  This can change if a transaction is deferred from one
    session to the next.  Transactions that are currently deferred
    (i.e. not attached to a session) are not counted.</li>
  <li>Date entered: the date on which the sale is entered into a
    transaction.  This will not change even when the transaction is
    deferred.</li>
</ol>
