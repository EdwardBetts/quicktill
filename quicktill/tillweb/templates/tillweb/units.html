{% block tillcontent %}

<p>This table defines the units in which the system counts the amount
  of stock held.  Each <a href="{% url "tillweb-stocktype-search" pubname=pubname %}">stock type</a> specifies which one of these will be used for that type of stock.</p>

<p>The "base unit" is the physical unit used by the system to count
  how much stock we have: when we have "1" of something, this is how
  much we have.</p>

<p>It isn't always sensible to price stock using base units.  For
  example, in the UK wine is generally bought in 75cl bottles
  (although sometimes also in 1.5l bottles, or 5l, 10l or 20l
  bags-in-boxes), but is sold in 125ml, 175ml or 250ml glasses.  175ml
  doesn't divide exactly into 75cl so we can't use "bottle" as the
  base unit; we use "ml" instead.  When we're setting a price for
  wine, though, we don't want to price per ml, we want to price per
  bottle.  This is what the "base units per item" and "item name"
  columns are for: the price set for a stock type is
  per <em>item</em>, not per base unit.</p>
