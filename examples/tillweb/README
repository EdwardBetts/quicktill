tillweb - legacy web interface
==============================

This is not the django-based web interface you're looking for!

This one is based on python-twisted-web and the cheetah template
engine.  It has lots of unmaintainable embedded SQL that doesn't match
the schema in quicktill/models.py (notably, the "stockonsale" table
has been merged with the "stock" table; see
examples/update-database-for-sqlalchemy for a description of the
changes).

Old documentation
-----------------

Resources available to view on the till web server:

 - / (overall) - a summary of recent events, index page
 - session/<number> - session totals
 - session/<number>/dept<number> - list of translines in a department
 - transaction/<number> - details of a transaction
 - stock - a list of all stock
 - stock/<number> - full details of a particular stock item

General rule - if a summary is displayed on a page, you can click on
it for a breakdown.
