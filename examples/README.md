Example scripts
===============

Most of these scripts are terribly out of date and are retained in the
hope that they might be updated someday.  Currently useful scripts
are:

 - haymakers.py is an example till configuration file, adapted from
   the one in use at the Haymakers in Cambridge.

 - login-scripts/ may still be useful in setting up automatic startup
   of the till on Ubuntu server or other upstart-based systems.

For the web interface, see [the tillweb
project](https://github.com/sde1000/quicktill-tillweb).
